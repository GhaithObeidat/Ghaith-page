  
  ## What is JavaScript?

   *JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages, every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at, displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS).*
   
   *A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions, Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.*
   **To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step neededto complete that task (a flowchart can help).**

 *A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.*

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

## Rules for naming variables

* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
* The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name. 
* You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript. 
* All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, butit is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases. 
* Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
first Name might be used to
store a person's first name,
lastName for their last name,
and age for their age. 
* If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
