## **Growth mindset**
  *I always see growth mindset as a life style of life choice, some people tend to learn from their mistakes and develop their characteristics and the they think of things, others don't, the just let things be and don't take accountability and they think that they shouldn't see better people as an inspirtion and take it as a personal threat, people like this don't try ti improve their personal skills or working skills they always hold grudges without having the urge to change what has to be changed, we all should focus on what we lack of and try as much as we can to encance our skills whether if it's personal or working skills but **without** being ungrateful, we always should be grateful and thankful for what we already have and still work and hope for the better.*

### **Self reminders of how to keep in growth mindset:**
* *Set a peronal goal and keep it between you and yourslef.**
* *Self learning is a must because you don't acheive your ultimate goals without digging deeper by yourself.*
* *Always compare yourslef to whom you used to be every once in a while to see the self growth you achieved so far.*
