## How does a computer work?

**A computer is a machine (hardware) that receives and processes data according to the instructions given to it, and after the data has been processed, the results of the processing are usually sent to an output device.**

*A computer couldn’t work without the motherboard. This vital circuit board ties everything together, It allows every part of your computer to receive power and communicate with each other. Everything that runs the computer or enhances its performance is either part of the motherboard or plugs into one of its expansion slots or ports. If a component is not connected to the motherboard, your computer won’t know that it’s there.*

*The input devices for feeding the computer with data and instructions can be a keyboard, mouse, scanner, or may be generated internally from ‘applications’ stored as programmed instructions (software). The processing of the data is done by the central processing unit (CPU), which is the heart of the computer. The output devices can be a screen (monitor), printer, plotter, speakers, ports, or another computer.*

*Elictric wires and circuits contains all the information in a computer, the more wires you have the more information you can store, more wires resutls more Bits.*

*Images are produced by combining pixels together to form a whole colored picture with 'RGB' color range. Sound as well is produced by a series of vibrations and the more bits you have the higher the range of numbers that produce sound.*
