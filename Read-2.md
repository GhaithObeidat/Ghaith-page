# Seeing Your Remotes

**By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.**


## Fetching

**Fetching entails pulling data that you don’t have from a remote project, using the command format:**         *git fetch [remote-name]*

## Pushing

**To push your changes “upstream” for sharing, you would use the following git push command format:**        *git push [remote-name][branch-name]*
