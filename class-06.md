## Object Literals
*A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.*
+ Like variables and named functions,
properties and methods have a
name and a value. In an object,
that name is called a key. 
+ An object cannot have two keys
with the same name. This is
because keys are used to access
their corresponding values. 
+ The value of a property can be a
string, number, Boolean, array, or
even another object. The value of a
method is always a function.
+ Variables have a name and you can assign them a
value of a string, number, or Boolean.
+ Arrays have a name and a group of values. (Each
item in an array is a name/value pair because it
has an index number and a value.)
+ Named functions have a name and value that is a
set of statements to run if the function is called.
+ Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs
(but the names are referred to as keys). 

## Document Object Model
+ The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
+ DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
+ You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
+ Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
+ From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
+ An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.
+ In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
+ Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
